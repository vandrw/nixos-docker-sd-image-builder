# Compose file which provides automagic building of NixOS SD images for AArch64 systems.
# Use together with `docker-compose.emulation.yml` if a transparent emulation layer is required.

# Comes out with sane defaults, feel free to configure as needed.
# NOTE: the configuration used to build NixOS resides in the parent directory as `sd-image.nix`

    # Main command line, left here so it can be changed easily. The container will:
    # - setup the environment. This includes adding the Nix executables to $PATH, along with the
    #   registration of an EXIT handler which will send a signal to `cleanup-qemu` when done.
    # - wait until `setup-qemu` is done by attempting to run an AArch64 binary. This works out of
    #   the box if running on AArch64.
    # - build the actual SD image.
    # - copy it to /build, which points by default to this directory.
